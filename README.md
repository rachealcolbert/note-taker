## Description

When a user opens the application, they are presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page. When they click the link, that are taken to a page with previously submitted notes.

Users can then choose to edit previously submitted notes or create a new note. After a user edits an old note or adds a new note, they can save their progress to return and view at a latter time.
